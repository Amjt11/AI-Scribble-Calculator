# Frontend part

## 📋 Overview
Built  using  ReactJS,  responsible  for  user interaction, displaying results, and sending requests to the backend. 

## ⚙️ Core Technologies
- **React** (v18.3.1) — UI library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** (v5.6.2) — Strongly-typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Vite** — Build tool for fast development and optimized production builds.

## 🎨 UI Libraries
- **Mantine** — UI Component Library (used for color swatches).
- **Radix UI** — Unstyled, accessible components for building custom UIs.
- **ShadCn** — Component library for modern React projects.

## 💅 Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework.
- **Tailwind Merge** — Merges Tailwind classes intelligently.
- **Tailwind Animate** — Pre-built animation utilities.

## 🔄 State & Routing
- **React Router DOM** (v7.0.1) — Declarative routing for React apps.

## 🌐 HTTP Client
- **Axios** (v1.7.8) — Handles HTTP requests from frontend to backend.

## 🧮 Key Components
- **Equation Input Form**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to enter mathematical equations. This form captures the input, validates it, and passes it to the backend for processing.

- **Real-time Feedback**: As users input equations, they receive real-time feedback in the form of results (calculated values, graphs, or LaTeX-rendered equations).

- **Graphical Output**: Users can see graphical representations of mathematical functions. The frontend uses libraries like **Chart.js** or **Plotly** to render the graphs.

- **LaTeX Rendering**: LaTeX expressions are rendered using **MathJax** or **KaTeX** to display mathematical formulas and equations in a readable and accurate format.
